# Roll-A-Ball
My First Game As A Game Programmer In Untiy 2018.2.6f1

Add everything when available.

Change 1.0 :-
-> Removed Plane in Level 7 used to trigger GameplayInvisibility Object as it caused an error:-
   - [Physics.PhysX] QuickHullConvexHullLib::findSimplex: Simplex input points appers to be coplanar.
UnityEngine.GUIUtility:ProcessEvent(Int32, IntPtr)
   - Failed to create Convex Mesh from source mesh "Plane". An internal unspecified error has occured that could mean the Quickhull algorithm found the input mesh topologically challenging.
-> Added Cube instead with trigger.
